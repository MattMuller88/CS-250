**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

It is very important when interpreting user needs to try to gain a deep undertanding of what they are looking to get out of the product. User stories can help with this by documenting the details of a specific need so that when we look to implement this need into the program, we do so in exactlty the way the user desires. User stories are particularly important for the tester who, after identifying and filling in any ambiguities, uses them to develop their test cases which will show whether or not the program meets all of its requirements.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When developing programs, I like to take a modular approach where I will work on and test chunks of code at a time rather than try to develop large sections all at once. One agile process that I plan on incorporating into my future development work is that of the review and retrospective. Gaining experience is one of the best ways to become a more successful developer, but all the experience in the world is useless if you don't learn from it. This is why it is so important to reflect on what went right, what went wrong, and what can be done better after every development project.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

When considering what it takes to be a good team member in software development, I believe that communication is the most important factor. In development, making sure that everyone is up to date and on the same page is absolutely vital to the success of a project. However, this is only possible if each member of the team effectively communicates their ideas, their progress, and perhaps most importantly, their struggles. When teams have open communication where they feel safe to share their struggles, it allows for other team members to step in and help relieve these issues and keep the project on track. This sharing of problems and ideas can be extremely helpful in making each member of the development team become better at their role.
